This means that on this date, the contract is settled, either through physical delivery of the asset or cash settlement.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Settlement<\/strong>: Upon expiration, contracts are settled based on the agreed terms.

Will 2022 be similar?<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>","content":"<h2 id=\"how-crypto-futures-work\">How Crypto Futures Work<\/h2>\r\n<p>Crypto futures trading is like making a bet on where the price of Bitcoin (or any other crypto) will go&mdash;without actually buying the asset. These contracts let traders agree on a future price and settle the difference when the contract expires (or before, if they choose). It&rsquo;s a high-stakes game where people try to predict the market, hedge risks, or just leverage price swings to make (or lose) money.<\/p>\r\n<h3>The Role of Margin and Leverage<\/h3>\r\n<p>Futures trading isn&rsquo;t just about calling the right price&mdash;it&rsquo;s also about how much capital you&rsquo;re willing (or able) to put on the line. This is where&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/coinbureau.com\/education\/cryptocurrency-margin-trading\/\">margin and leverage<\/a>&nbsp;come into play.<\/p>\r\n<h3><strong>Margin: Your Ticket to the Game<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p>Think of margin as a deposit you put down to open a futures trade. It&rsquo;s not a fee&mdash;it&rsquo;s just collateral to prove you can afford to be in the trade.<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Initial Margin<\/strong>: The upfront amount you need to put down to open a position.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Maintenance Margin<\/strong>: The minimum balance required to keep your position open. If your trade starts tanking and your funds dip below this level, you&rsquo;ll get a margin call&mdash;basically a warning to add more funds or risk having your trade liquidated.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3><strong>Leverage: The Double-Edged Sword<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn4740.cdn4s8.io.vn\/media\/blogs\/crypto-basics\/shutterstock_1127294711.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"617\"><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Leverage is the reason futures trading is so exciting&mdash;and so dangerous. It lets you control a much bigger position with a smaller amount of money. A 10:1 leverage means you can open a $10,000 trade with just $1,000 of your own funds. Sounds great, right? Well, it&rsquo;s all fun and games until the market moves against you.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Example:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>If Bitcoin&rsquo;s price jumps 5%, and you&rsquo;re using 10x leverage, you don&rsquo;t just make 5%&mdash;you make 50% on your trade!<\/li>\r\n<li>But if Bitcoin drops 5%, that same leverage wipes out half your capital. And if it drops 10%? You&rsquo;re liquidated&mdash;your position is closed automatically because you ran out of margin.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s why leverage is a tool best used with caution. It amplifies both profits and losses, which is why seasoned traders always set stop-loss orders and keep an eye on their margin levels.<\/p>\r\n<p>At the end of the day, crypto futures trading is a high-risk, high-reward market.

Will 2022 be similar?<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>","content":"<h2 id=\"how-crypto-futures-work\">How Crypto Futures Work<\/h2>\r\n<p>Crypto futures trading is like making a bet on where the price of Bitcoin (or any other crypto) will go&mdash;without actually buying the asset. These contracts let traders agree on a future price and settle the difference when the contract expires (or before, if they choose). It&rsquo;s a high-stakes game where people try to predict the market, hedge risks, or just leverage price swings to make (or lose) money.<\/p>\r\n<h3>The Role of Margin and Leverage<\/h3>\r\n<p>Futures trading isn&rsquo;t just about calling the right price&mdash;it&rsquo;s also about how much capital you&rsquo;re willing (or able) to put on the line. This is where&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/coinbureau.com\/education\/cryptocurrency-margin-trading\/\">margin and leverage<\/a>&nbsp;come into play.<\/p>\r\n<h3><strong>Margin: Your Ticket to the Game<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p>Think of margin as a deposit you put down to open a futures trade. It&rsquo;s not a fee&mdash;it&rsquo;s just collateral to prove you can afford to be in the trade.<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Initial Margin<\/strong>: The upfront amount you need to put down to open a position.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Maintenance Margin<\/strong>: The minimum balance required to keep your position open. If your trade starts tanking and your funds dip below this level, you&rsquo;ll get a margin call&mdash;basically a warning to add more funds or risk having your trade liquidated.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3><strong>Leverage: The Double-Edged Sword<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn4740.cdn4s8.io.vn\/media\/blogs\/crypto-basics\/shutterstock_1127294711.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"617\"><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Leverage is the reason futures trading is so exciting&mdash;and so dangerous. It lets you control a much bigger position with a smaller amount of money. A 10:1 leverage means you can open a $10,000 trade with just $1,000 of your own funds. Sounds great, right? Well, it&rsquo;s all fun and games until the market moves against you.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Example:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>If Bitcoin&rsquo;s price jumps 5%, and you&rsquo;re using 10x leverage, you don&rsquo;t just make 5%&mdash;you make 50% on your trade!<\/li>\r\n<li>But if Bitcoin drops 5%, that same leverage wipes out half your capital. And if it drops 10%? You&rsquo;re liquidated&mdash;your position is closed automatically because you ran out of margin.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s why leverage is a tool best used with caution. It amplifies both profits and losses, which is why seasoned traders always set stop-loss orders and keep an eye on their margin levels.<\/p>\r\n<p>At the end of the day, crypto futures trading is a high-risk, high-reward market. If you don&rsquo;t respect margin and leverage, the market won&rsquo;t respect you either.<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"types-of-crypto-futures-contracts\">Types of Crypto Futures Contracts<\/h2>\r\n<p>Futures contracts come in two main flavors: traditional futures and perpetual futures. Understanding the difference is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the crypto derivatives market effectively.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Perpetual vs. Traditional Futures<\/h3>\r\n<h3><strong>Traditional Futures Contracts<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p>Traditional futures are agreements to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a specific future date. These contracts have been staples in financial markets for decades, allowing traders to hedge risks or speculate on price movements of various assets, including commodities, stocks, and now, cryptocurrencies.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Characteristics:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Expiration Date<\/strong>: Traditional futures come with a set expiration date. This means that on this date, the contract is settled, either through physical delivery of the asset or cash settlement.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Settlement<\/strong>: Upon expiration, contracts are settled based on the agreed terms. For instance, in cash-settled contracts, the difference between the contract price and the asset's spot price is exchanged.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><strong>Perpetual Futures Contracts<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<h3>Abstract's Consumer Crypto Vision<\/h3>\r\n<p>Perpetual futures, often referred to as \"perps,\" are a newer breed of derivative contracts, especially prevalent in the crypto space.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Characteristics:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>No Expiration Date<\/strong>: Unlike traditional futures, perpetual contracts do not have a set expiration or settlement date. Traders can hold positions indefinitely, provided they meet the margin requirements.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Funding Rates<\/strong>: To keep the contract price tethered closely to the underlying asset's spot price, perpetual futures employ a mechanism known as the funding rate. This periodic payment between long and short position holders incentivizes alignment between the contract price and the spot price.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2 id=\"abstract-technical-overview\">Abstract Technical Overview<\/h2>\r\n<p>While Abstract functions as an independent layer-2 network, it does not operate in isolation. Instead, it builds on the&nbsp;<strong>ZK Stack<\/strong>, an open-source modular framework developed by ZKsync. This means that rather than creating its own rollup infrastructure&mdash;including sequencers, provers, and settlement mechanisms&mdash;Abstract leverages ZKsync&rsquo;s existing infrastructure to streamline development and interoperability.<\/p>\r\n<h3>ZK Stack Integration<\/h3>\r\n<p>The ZK Stack is an open-source framework designed to simplify the creation of ZK rollups. Known as ZK Chains, layer-2 networks achieve scalability by using zero-knowledge proofs. Abstract is one such ZK rollup, leveraging the ZK Stack to reduce development complexity while ensuring high security, modularity, and interoperability with other ZK-powered chains.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Purpose of ZK Stack<\/h3>\r\n<p>The ZK Stack is a foundational framework that streamlines the development of scalable L2 chains. Instead of building a new rollup infrastructure, chains using the ZK Stack inherit core components from ZKsync, significantly reducing technical overhead while maintaining Ethereum&rsquo;s security guarantees.<\/p>","seo_title":"Historically January is a GREAT Month for Crypto","seo_description":null,"seo_keyword":null,"search_unicode":"kadena deepdive the blockchain trilemma solved","lang":"en"}],"TagsRelation":[{"id":18,"foreign_id":6,"type":"article_detail","tag_id":3},{"id":17,"foreign_id":6,"type":"article_detail","tag_id":2},{"id":16,"foreign_id":6,"type":"article_detail","tag_id":1}],"TagArticle":{"id":18,"foreign_id":6,"type":"article_detail","tag_id":3},"ArticlesAttribute":[{"id":13,"article_id":6,"attribute_id":4,"value":"{\"en\":\"\"}"}],"CategoriesArticle":[{"id":16,"article_id":6,"category_id":38}]}}}
